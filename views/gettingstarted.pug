                    strong full sun
                    | , meaning six or more hours of sunlight a night. 
                    | But ideally most of them would have eight or ten hours of sunlight. 
                    | The south side of your house usually has the best sunlight, with west and east sides second-best. 
                    | It's also convenient to have your garden near a water source, so you can water the plants with a hose or fill your watering can easily.

                    strong container gardening 
                    | would be best for you. Container gardening refers to placing your plants in pots or other planters,

                    | if you pay attention to sizing requirements for different seeds, it can work perfectly well and offers you flexibility.

                    | It allows you to have greater control over the soil, instead of using what is in the ground. 
                    | It also can help protect from weeds, slugs, and other pests. But, you must build or purchase an adaquate structure which adds a bit of overhead to your project.

                    | The simplest way to start gardening vegetables is to purchase some 
                    strong starts
                    | . The term vegetable "start" means a newly grown vegetable that has been grown from seed and is sold from a nursery for you to plant in your garden. 
                    | Typically you prepare whatever method of gardening you've chosen (container, raised bed, or in the ground) and scoop out an appropriately sized hole for your start. 
                    | Then you place it in, fill in the gaps with soil, and give it its first water.
